# Detection and classification of cyberullying using machine leanrning algorithms in memes dataset

	Cyberbullying emerged as a serious form of bullying via electronic means due to recent exponential growth of social media users. Social media networks provides an optimal environment for bullies to use these networks as vulnerable hotspots for preparation, creating plan of invasion and intrude /attack the victim’s privacy. So it is necessary to find a suitable action in order to detect and prevent cyberbullying in social media platforms.
	In this process of detection of cyberbullying, Machine learning can be helpful to detect language patterns of text messages, comments, and meme texts that are frequently used by bullies. Hence machine learning algorithms can generate a model to automatically detect cyberbullying actions from the social network sites. 
 	The project proposes a semi supervised machine learning approach for detecting and preventing cyberbullying. Several classifiers are used to train and recognize bullying actions. The evaluation of the proposed approach on collected cyberbullying dataset (from Library of Congress) shows that Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieves an accuracy of 84.93 % and Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB) achieves 82.28%. Finally, the conclusion is SVM outperforms Multinomial Naïve Bayes with similar working principle and same data
